## Installation

- In your Index.js, make sure that Node.js is installed and run `npm init -y` in your terminal to activate your package json.
- Install Inquirer by entering `npm i inquirer@8.2.4` and `npm i fs` into the terminal.
- The included files contain the template for the Readme document. If you would like to add or modify the questions for the inquirer prompt, they are in the generateMarkdown.js file.

## Usage

- Open VSCode with the included Directory. In the Index.js file, open a new terminal and (assuming you have correctly installed both FS and Inquirer), type `node index.js`. This will start the prompt for each section of your Readme.md.
- Once you arrive at the end of the prompt, you will recieve a message informing you that the file has been created.
- In your VS Code explorer menu, you will see the creation of your document!
